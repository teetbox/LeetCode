// Substring with Concatenation of All Words

/*
 You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
 
 For example, given:
 s: "barfoothefoobarman"
 words: ["foo", "bar"]
 
 You should return the indices: [0,9].
 (order does not matter).
